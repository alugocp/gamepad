# SNESmap USB Gamepad driver
I made a driver for a USB-connected SNES gamepad so I could play a Super Mario World emulator. The prototype is written in Python and the final version's in C.

The final C version is not yet finished.

## Run
#### Prototype
```
sudo python3 prototype.py
```
#### Final
```
make
./bin/driver
```
